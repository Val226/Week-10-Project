The instructions for this project are: 

Using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript create a single page website that contains the following:
- A Bootstrap styled table representing your choice of data.
- A Bootstrap styled form that allows a user to add a new row to the table when clicking on submit.

The theme I'm going to use with this project is cats.
My table is going to have columns for:
  - Owner's Name
  - Cat's Name
  - Cat's Age
  - Cat's Favorite Toy

The form is going to be so you can add your own cat's information to the table.

Once done, I will have to make a video explaining my code, it will need to be under 5 minutes long.
